[00:07.95] Bustling city
[00:10.94] I love the way you greet me every time
[00:15.30] Streets buzzing with life
[00:27.80] 
[00:19.86] Crowds keep flowing
[00:23.71] Wherever they will lead me's where I'll go
[00:28.47] It's where I belong
[00:37.97] 
[00:31.63] Been chasing this dream
[00:34.18] Where all of our voices unite
[00:37.31] In perfect harmony
[00:40.34] And I hear it so clearly this time
[00:57.34] 
[00:43.52] You know this is our haven
[00:47.91] Haven, oh
[00:56.36] You know this is our haven
[01:00.86] Haven, oh
[01:05.36] 
[01:05.95] You know this is our haven
[01:09.11] You know this is our haven
[01:22.11] 
[01:21.97] You know this is our haven
[01:34.97] 
[01:37.62] Temperature rising
[01:40.69] Once I'm here no drink can cool me down
[01:45.33] I'm burning inside
[01:54.33] 
[01:49.22] Slowly but surely
[01:53.27] Feel all my worries fading as we dance
[01:58.19] The sun in my eyes
[02:07.19] 
[02:01.30] I'm living a dream
[02:03.71] Where all of our hearts come alive
[02:06.92] To write a symphony
[02:09.92] And I've never been so sure in my life
[02:28.92] 
[02:13.11] You know this is our haven
[02:18.19] Haven, oh
[02:25.97] You know this is our haven
[02:30.26] Haven, oh
[02:34.76] 
[02:35.54] You know this is our haven
[02:38.71] You know this is our haven
[02:51.71] 
[02:51.57] You know this is our haven
[02:55.81] Haven, oh
[03:01.22] You know this is our haven
[03:04.34] You know this is our haven
